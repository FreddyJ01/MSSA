Create an array-based stack class that manages integer elements and supports standard stack operations.

Your class should include a constructor that takes the maximum size of the stack and initializes an internal array along with a variable to track the top of the stack.

Implement methods to push an element onto the stack (checking for stack overflow), pop the top element (checking for stack underflow), and peek to view the top element without removing it.

In your Mainmethod, instantiate the stack with a size of 5, push the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order, display the stack contents from top to bottom, perform a pop, then a peek, then another pop, and finally display the updated stack contents again, ensuring that your implementation correctly updates the top index and handles overflow and underflow conditions.
