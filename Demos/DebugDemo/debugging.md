# Debugging and Unit Testing

We are expected to write and implement unit tests.

## VS Code Debugger Controls

Here are the main controls you'll use when debugging in VS Code:

- **Continue**: Runs the program until the next breakpoint or the end.
- **Step Over**: Executes the current line and moves to the next, but does not enter into function calls.
- **Step Into**: Executes the current line and, if it’s a function call, enters into that function to debug inside it.
- **Step Out**: If you’re inside a function, runs the rest of the function and returns to the calling code.
- **Restart**: Stops the current debugging session and starts it again from the beginning.
- **Stop**: Ends the debugging session and terminates the program.

These controls help you navigate and inspect your code’s execution flow to find bugs and understand logic.


Debugging is the process of finding and resolving errors in code, faulty logic, unexpected behavior, or application crashes.

## Testing vs. Debugging

- **Testing:** Finding bugs before runtime.
- **Debugging:** Finding bugs after runtime.

---

## Tools for Debugging

- **VS Code**
- Inspect variable values
- Set breakpoints
- Trace order of execution (line by line)

---

## Exceptions

Exceptions are unexpected conditions that occur during runtime and typically cause the application to crash.

**Address exceptions using:**  
`try` and `catch` blocks

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Run Code in the Debug Environment

1. **Create a new code project**
2. **Examine launch configurations for debugging**
3. **Run your code from the Run and Debug view**
4. **Examine the output from your application**
